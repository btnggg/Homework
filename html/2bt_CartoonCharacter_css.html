		<h1>Pooh's friends</h1>
		<body>
			<ul>
				<li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigger">Tigger</a> is a fictional tiger character originally introduced in A. A. Milne's book The House at Pooh Corner. Like other Pooh characters, Tigger is based on one of Christopher Robin Milne's stuffed animals. Nowadays he is also widely recognized as reinterpreted by the Disney studios, with distinctive orange and black stripes, large eyes, a long chin, a springy tail, and (the one detail originating from A. A. Milne) his love of bouncing. As he says himself, "Bouncing is what Tiggers do best."</li>
				<li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piglet_(Winnie-the-Pooh)">Piglet</a> is a fictional character from A. A. Milne's Winnie‑the‑Pooh books. Piglet is Winnie‑the‑Pooh's closest friend amongst all the toys/animals featured in the stories. Despite the fact that he is a "Very Small Animal" of a generally timid disposition, he tries to be brave and on occasion conquers his fears.</li>
				<li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeyore">Eeyore</a> is a character in the Winnie-the-Pooh books by A. A. Milne. He is generally characterized as a pessimistic, gloomy, depressed, anhedonic, old grey stuffed donkey who is a friend of the title character, Winnie-the-Pooh.</li>
